#  Sampling Assignment — Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Python implementation to explore how different **sampling techniques** affect the performance of various **machine learning classifiers** on an imbalanced credit card fraud dataset.

Imbalanced data is common in fraud detection problems. Without proper handling, models tend to predict only the majority (legitimate) class, failing to detect the rare but important fraudulent transactions. This project balances the data and compares multiple sampling strategies and models.

##  Project Goals

1. Handle class imbalance via undersampling  
2. Implement multiple sampling techniques  
3. Train five different classifiers  
4. Compare model performance across sampling methods  
5. Identify which sampling strategy works best per model

##  How It Works (Step-by-Step)

---

1️⃣ Load and Balance Dataset

    The script loads the CSV dataset, then uses undersampling to balance the number of fraud and non-fraud records.

    df_bal = pd.concat([majority_down, minority])

2️⃣ Apply Sampling Methods

    Each sampling method generates a new subset of the balanced dataset for model training.

    Example — Random Sampling

    idx = np.random.choice(len(X), sample_size, replace=False)
    Xs = X.iloc[idx]
    ys = y.iloc[idx]

3️⃣ Train Models and Evaluate

    Each sampled dataset is split into training and test sets (80/20).

    Models are trained on the training set and accuracy is recorded on the test set.

    model.fit(Xtr, ytr)
    accuracy_score(yte, pred)

 Results

    The script prints and saves a CSV file showing accuracy scores for each model on each sampling method.



    The best sampling method is also determined for each model based on highest accuracy.
